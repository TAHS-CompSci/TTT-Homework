Tic Tac Toe Homework

You are being given access to a functional program called ticTacToe.py. When executed, this program allows you to run the ever popular childhood game - Tic Tac Toe. 

Be aware of the commands for the grid. When prompted you must enter one of the following: 

* top-L, top-M, top-R
* mid-L, mid-M, mid-R
* low-L, low-M, low-R

Each of the aforementioned commands refers to a place on the tic tac toe board. 

If you play this game long enough you will notice several issues because it is not a finished game/product!

YOUR MISSION SHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO ACCEPT:
1. Validate a winning string of characters from the perspective of both players. Print the winner out to the screen. 
2. Create a scoring system that tallies how many wins each player has accumulated. 
3. Create a high_score system that keeps track of the historical highest score for wins. 
  * This can overall wins or could be split between both players.
  
Advanced feature:
* Secure the program from potential breaks - you might come across issues that need to be resolved in order to keep the program secure:
  * What happens when you try entering any other text than the grid commands? 

Much more advanced feature:
* Find a way to check if the game has no winner before all spots have been filled.
